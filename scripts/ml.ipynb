Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, … V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-senstive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.\n",

    "To solve the unbalance problem you can either over-sample or under-sample your dataset. In this notebook we will implement over-sampling. There are 3 main over-sampling techniques. \n",
    "1- Naive random over-sampling :- generate new samples by randomly sampling with replacement the current available samples.\n",
    "2-Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE):- It generate synthetic samples by applying KNN approach by combining K nearest neighbours and generate new synthetic sample in vector space.\n",
    "3- The Adaptive Synthetic (ADASYN):- it's very similar to SMOTE however it generate more sample and give more weight more weight on values that been originally misclassified.\n"
